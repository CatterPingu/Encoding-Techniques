# Encoding-Techniques

This repository contains notebooks demonstrating different techniques for encoding categorical variables in machine learning datasets.

## Notebooks Included

### Count Encoding
count_encoding.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to use count encoding, which replaces categorical values with their count in the dataset.

## One-Hot Encoding
one_hot_encoding.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to use one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each unique categorical value.

## Datasets Used

The notebooks use a sample dataset called the mercedesbenz dataset.

## Dependencies

The notebooks were created using Python 3.10. They require the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy

## Conclusion

These notebooks provide an introduction to different techniques for encoding categorical variables, which can improve the performance of machine learning models.
